## Branch Naming Conventions

To keep our repository clean and organized, we follow these branch naming conventions:

### Types of Branches

- **Feature branches:** `feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
  - Example: `feature/1234-new-login-page`
- **Bugfix branches:** `bugfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
  - Example: `bugfix/5678-fix-login-bug`
- **Hotfix branches:** `hotfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
  - Example: `hotfix/2345-critical-fix`
- **Release branches:** `release/<version>`
  - Example: `release/v1.2.0`
- **Development branches:** `develop/<short-description>`
  - Example: `develop/ui-enhancements`
- **Experimental branches:** `experiment/<short-description>`
  - Example: `experiment/new-ui-idea`

### Guidelines

1. **Issue ID:** Include the issue or task ID related to the branch.
2. **Short Description:** Use a brief, hyphenated description of the branch purpose.
3. **Lowercase Letters:** Use lowercase letters in branch names.
4. **Hyphens for Spaces:** Use hyphens `-` to separate words.

Following these conventions helps everyone understand the purpose of each branch and keeps our development process streamlined.
